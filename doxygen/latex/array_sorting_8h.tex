\doxysubsection{Detailed Description}
library that controls reading from and writing to the standard streams. 

\textquotesingle{}\#\textquotesingle{} is called preprocessor directive. \textquotesingle{}\texorpdfstring{$<$}{<}\texorpdfstring{$>$}{>}\textquotesingle{} is used for pre-\/defined header files. It read the program before it is compiled and executes only those lines which starts with \textquotesingle{}\#\textquotesingle{}

user-\/defined header file \mbox{\hyperlink{array_sorting_8h}{section1/array\+Sorting.\+h}} to propagate declarations to code file.

library that controls reading from and writing to the standard streams. A framework that relates a time point to real physical time. The library provides at least three clocks that provide means to express the current time. library that offers reliable and efficient functions for dynamic memory allocation, conversion between datatypes, pseudo-\/random number generation, process control, searching and sorting, math, and multibyte or wide characters. library which helps us in manipulating the output of the program. user-\/defined header to propagate declarations to code file.
